                    Hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, which is the primary
                    protocol used to send data between a web browser and a website. HTTPS is encrypted in order to
                    increase security of data transfer.

                    Through the WWW, users can access web pages over the internet by following a series of HTTP links.
                    To retrieve and view these pages, users need to use a browser installed on the computer, such as
                    Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. Both the internet and the web operate within a
                    client-server model.

                    In the DNS hierarchy, a top-level domain (TLD) represents the first stop after the root zone. In
                    simpler terms, a TLD is everything that follows the final dot of a domain name. For example, in the
                    domain name 'google.com', '.com' is the TLD. Some other popular TLDs include '. org', '.

                    The Marquee HTML tag is a non-standard HTML element which is used to scroll a image or text horizontally or vertically. In simple words, you can say that it scrolls the image or text up, down, left or right automatically. Marquee tag was first introduced in early versions of Microsoft's Internet Explorer.

                    HTML defines six levels of headings. A heading element implies all the font changes, paragraph breaks before and after, and any white space necessary to render the heading. The heading elements are H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6 with H1 being the highest (or most important) level and H6 the least.

                    After some research I found that you can't nest an iframe inside of an iframe in the same file. Instead what you need to do is add a reference to the child iframe as the src attribute for the parent iframe. What I did was create a main. html file and a youtube.
